# RhoSocial ActiveRecord MySQL Backend Knowledge Base

Welcome to the knowledge base for the RhoSocial ActiveRecord MySQL backend (`rhosocial-activerecord-mysql`). This directory contains essential information to help developers and AI assistants understand and work with the MySQL backend implementation.

## Purpose

This knowledge base serves to:

1. Document the architecture and design of the MySQL backend
2. Provide guidance for developers working with the codebase
3. Help AI assistants understand the repository structure and patterns
4. Document testing strategies and configurations
5. Explain MySQL-specific features and optimizations

## Files Overview

- `testing.md` - Comprehensive guide to testing the MySQL backend, including shared test suite integration and MySQL-specific test patterns
- `mysql_backend.md` - General knowledge base covering architecture, features, configuration, and development guidelines
- `architecture.md` - Detailed architectural overview of the MySQL backend implementation (coming soon)

## Getting Started

For AI assistants or developers new to this repository:

1. Start with `mysql_backend.md` for an overview of the backend implementation
2. Review `testing.md` to understand the testing approach and requirements
3. Examine the codebase structure following the patterns documented
4. Set up the MySQL server and run the test suite to verify the setup

## Key Concepts

- The MySQL backend is a separate package that extends the core `rhosocial-activerecord`
- It reuses test suites from `rhosocial-activerecord-testsuite` while providing MySQL-specific implementations
- The backend supports MySQL-specific features like JSON, full-text search, and window functions
- PYTHONPATH configuration is required for test execution due to the multi-package architecture
