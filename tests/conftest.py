This is the root pytest configuration file for the rhosocial-activerecord-mysql package's test suite.

Its primary responsibility is to configure the environment so that the external

implementations (Providers) defined within this project.

# acts as a bridge, pointing the testsuite to the correct import path.

# `setdefault` is used to ensure that this value is set only if it hasn't been
# set already, allowing for overrides in different environments if needed.
