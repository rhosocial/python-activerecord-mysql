"""
This bridge file imports the `mapped_models_fixtures` from the testsuite's basic feature
conftest and then wildcard imports all test cases related to mapped models
from the testsuite.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT add any test logic directly in this file.
- This file is solely responsible for wiring up the testsuite's generic tests
  with the backend's specific fixtures and configuration.
