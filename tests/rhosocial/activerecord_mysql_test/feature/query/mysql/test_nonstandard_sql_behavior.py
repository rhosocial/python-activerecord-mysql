# tests/rhosocial/activerecord_mysql_test/feature/query/mysql/test_nonstandard_sql_behavior.py
"""
MySQL-specific tests for non-standard SQL behavior.

This module contains tests that verify MySQL's lenient handling of SQL statements
that violate the SQL standard. These tests are intentionally placed in the
backend-specific directory (feature/query/mysql/) rather than in the testsuite
because the behavior being tested is NOT SQL-standard compliant.

## Why These Tests Are Backend-Specific

The testsuite package is designed to contain only SQL-standard compliant tests
that should pass on all backends. However, different database backends have
different levels of strictness when handling non-standard SQL:

- PostgreSQL: Strictly enforces SQL standard, rejects invalid aggregate queries
- MySQL: Lenient, allows non-standard SQL in many cases
- SQLite: Very lenient, allows many non-standard SQL constructs

These tests specifically verify MySQL's lenient behavior, which differs from
the SQL standard. Therefore, they cannot be placed in the testsuite as they
would fail on PostgreSQL (which correctly rejects the invalid SQL).

    """
    Test that MySQL allows ORDER BY in aggregate queries without GROUP BY.
    
    ## Why This Test Is Backend-Specific (Not In Testsuite)
    
    This test verifies behavior that violates the SQL standard:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders ORDER BY order_number
    ```
    
    According to SQL standard, when using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, etc.)
    without a GROUP BY clause, the ORDER BY columns must either:
    1. Appear in the GROUP BY clause, or
    2. Be used in an aggregate function
    
    Since COUNT(*) returns a single row, ORDER BY is semantically meaningless.
    PostgreSQL correctly rejects this as a GroupingError.
    
    MySQL, however, allows this non-standard behavior without error.
    This test verifies MySQL's lenient handling, which is backend-specific.
    
    ## Expected Behavior
    
    - PostgreSQL: Raises GroupingError (SQL standard compliant)
    - MySQL: Executes without error (lenient) <-- This test

    """
    Test that MySQL allows exists() on a query with retained ORDER BY.
    
    ## Why This Test Is Backend-Specific (Not In Testsuite)
    
    This test demonstrates query object reuse where ORDER BY is retained
    across different operations, leading to non-standard SQL:
    
    ```sql
    -- First operation (valid)
    SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY order_number LIMIT 1
    
    -- Second operation (invalid in standard SQL)
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE ... ORDER BY order_number
    ```
    
    The second query is invalid because COUNT(*) returns one row,
    making ORDER BY meaningless. PostgreSQL raises GroupingError.
    
    This test verifies that MySQL handles this gracefully without error.

    ## Note on Test Design
    
    The standard-compliant approach (as implemented in testsuite) is to use
    fresh query objects for semantically different operations. This test
    intentionally tests the non-standard behavior for MySQL compatibility.
