Test Provider Registry

This module registers concrete implementations of test suite interfaces.
The registry system allows the test suite to be decoupled from specific
backend implementations, enabling the same tests to run against different
database backends.

Capability Negotiation in Testing
---------------------------------
The test suite uses the capability negotiation system to determine which
tests should run against which backends. Each backend declares its capabilities
through the DatabaseCapabilities system, and tests can check for required
capabilities before execution.

This approach enables:
1. Automatic test skipping for unsupported features
2. Backend-specific test execution
3. Fine-grained feature testing
4. Single source of truth for feature support

When a test needs to check for a capability, it can access the backend's
capabilities property and use the appropriate checking methods. Tests that
require specific capabilities will automatically be skipped on backends
that don't support those features.
