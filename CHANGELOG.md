## [v1.0.0.dev15] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added named query and named procedure CLI subcommands for MySQL backend. Added ConcurrencyAware protocol implementation for MySQL. Added named connection support with MySQL CLI integration. ([#35](https://github.com/rhosocial/python-activerecord-mysql/issues/35))
